### settlersofcatannn - Settlers of Catan for neural network applications
#### Prerequisite
* Netbeans
* At this point in the project neural network applications are limited by the project currently only being in Java but a python build will be available by 6/20/2019 feel free to contact me through my socials if you would like to see this come out sooner I'd be happy to the month delay is just because I have no current motivation to port it over since I just want to play it with friends over the internet :)
* I plan on making a python port but this was a game originally designed to be played between friends and my team only knew Java networking so we just planned that would be easier although not as practical for modern nn applications
